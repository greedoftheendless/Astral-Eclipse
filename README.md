🌌 Welcome to Astral-Eclipse

Astral-Eclipse is our debut project, created for a hackathon competition.
🚀 About the Project

The core idea behind Astral-Eclipse is to build a free, beginner-friendly educational website using only basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our goal was to make learning accessible and straightforward, especially for newcomers stepping into the world of web development.
